<p>The model have overall accuracy of 80% and a good P-value. I am sure it can be improved, but now I do not have much time, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Here you can see some plots that we have produced to pic features. We have plotted all the features (and thier influence on classe-variable), but here we give just sevetral examplese (since it is a standard procedure).</p>
